A simple web reporting app designed to speed up severe weather reports being sent to NWS offices via Twitter(X).

All data is open source and free to use/modify. Simply host report buddy on an HTTPS enabled web server and it an be used as is. 
This is one of my first projects so bear with me as I figure out how to modify and host things.
